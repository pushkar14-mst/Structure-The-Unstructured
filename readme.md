# Structure The Unstructure

## The idea behind this project is to facillitate data experts with a tool to process unstructured form of data. For this project, the formats were limited to audio , image and log files. What this tool will do is basicly take in unstructured data as input and return comma seperated values (csv) format as output.

## The data will be processed under a pipeline which extracts features (pre-selected) for that particular format, and then the file would be preprocessed and finally the finally would be dataset ready.

## Usage

## Running the python model

```bash
python3 model.py
```

## Running the client

```bash
cd client
npm i
npm run dev
```
